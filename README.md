## What is Mesu?

**Mesu** (◎˙┆˙) is a minimalist constructed language built from 48 atomic roots, 13 phonemes, and two writing systems. The name means "say-stuff" — *me* (say) + *su* (stuff) = language. It named itself.

This isn't just a conlang. This repository captures a moment of genuine insight — the frozen-in-time record of when I realized something fundamental about myself, aided by a collaboration with Claude (Opus 4.5).

## Features

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Phonology** | 8 consonants, 5 vowels, CV(n) syllable structure |
| **Lexicon** | 48 experiential root primitives |
| **Grammar** | 5 bare-vowel particles (i/a/e/o/u), strict SVO |
| **Print Script** | Unicode box-drawing glyphs with positional vowel dots |
| **Cursive Script** | Zero-lift continuous stroke system |

## Quick Taste

## The Story

You heard of 5-hour energy? This is **5-hour conlang**.

On 2025-12-01, I sat down with Claude and built an entire language from scratch. Not just vocabulary — a complete phonological system, 48 semantic primitives derived from experiential concepts, two distinct writing systems optimized for different contexts, and a grammar that uses bare vowels as unambiguous particles.

But the real story isn't the language.

The real story is what happened while building it. Creating Mesu became the catalyst for a realization I'd been circling for 40 years: that a childhood label ("you're stupid because you're lazy") had defined my entire life path — and that it was never true.

This repo contains both the language and the record of that insight. The file `insight-gained.md` captures that moment. The PDFs in `my-lang-convo-with-claude/` preserve the full conversation chronologically.

## Why "5hr-conlang"?

Because that's how long it took. And because the constraint forced clarity. When you have 5 hours to build a language, you can't waste time on unnecessary complexity. Every phoneme earns its place. Every root justifies its existence.

The result is a language that feels *inevitable* — like it was always there, waiting to be uncovered rather than invented.

## Documentation

The complete Mesu specification lives in `mesu-good.zip` and includes:

- Full phoneme inventory with articulatory descriptions
- All 48 roots with semantic fields
- Grammar rules and sentence patterns
- Print and Cursive script specifications
- Unicode glyph mappings
- Sample texts and phrases

## A Note on AI Collaboration

This language was co-created with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). I don't say "generated by" — I say *co-created*. The process was genuinely collaborative: I brought the constraints, the aesthetic sensibilities, the phonotactic preferences. Claude brought tireless iteration, instant feedback, and the ability to hold the entire system in context while we refined it.

More importantly, Claude helped me see something about myself that I couldn't see alone. That matters. That's documented here too.

Do whatever you want with Mesu. Speak it. Write it. Modify it. Build upon it. The only thing I ask — not legally, just as a human request — is that if Mesu helps you see something about yourself, you pay that forward somehow.
