# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository contains a constructed language specification, documentation, and personal narrative content. Traditional software security concerns (vulnerabilities, exploits, etc.) are not applicable.

However, there are other considerations:

## Content Sensitivity

### Personal Content

This repository contains `insight-gained.md` and related materials discussing:
- Mental health and childhood experiences
- Personal identity and self-discovery
- The author's psychological journey

This content is intentionally public as part of the project's transparency. However:

- **Do not** use this content to harass, mock, or target the author
- **Do not** take quotes out of context in ways that misrepresent the author's intent
- **Do** treat this content with the same respect you'd want for your own vulnerable moments

### Reporting Content Concerns

If you believe any content in this repository:
- Violates someone's privacy inappropriately
- Contains information that could cause harm if misused
- Has been taken out of context elsewhere in harmful ways

Contact: **security@whispr.dev**

We will respond within **72 hours**.

## Intellectual Property

### License: CC0 1.0 Universal

Mesu is released into the public domain. You are free to:
- Use it commercially
- Modify it
- Create derivative works
- Use it without attribution

**However**, the personal narrative content (`insight-gained.md` and conversation logs) is released under CC0 for transparency, not as an invitation to plagiarize someone's life story. Use with integrity.

### Attribution Requests (Non-Binding)

While not legally required, we appreciate:
- Acknowledging Mesu's origins if you build upon it significantly
- Linking back to this repository for learners to find the source
- Not claiming to have invented Mesu yourself

## AI Collaboration Transparency

This project was co-created with Claude (Anthropic). We believe in transparency about AI involvement in creative works. If you use Mesu in contexts where AI involvement matters (academic work, published materials, etc.), please note this origin.

## Responsible Use

Mesu is a language. Languages can be used to say anything. We ask that you:

- **Don't** use Mesu to obscure harmful content (threats, harassment, illegal activity)
- **Don't** claim Mesu texts say something they don't in order to deceive
- **Do** use Mesu for creative expression, learning, connection, and joy

## No Warranty

This language specification is provided "as-is." We make no guarantees about:
- Linguistic completeness
- Suitability for any particular purpose
- Freedom from ambiguity or edge cases

It's a 5-hour conlang. It has exactly as much polish as that implies.
