## v0.2.0 — Script Systems (2025-12-01)
**MILESTONE: Two writing systems**

- Alveolars: │ (t), ╎ (n), ┆ (s), ╰ (l)
- Velar: └ (k)
- Vowel dots positioned spatially (5 positions)
- Grammar particles as horizontal lines

**Cursive Script:**
- Zero-lift design for continuous writing
- Exit direction encodes following vowel
- Minimal stroke count per syllable

## v0.1.0 — Phonology & Roots (2025-12-01)
**MILESTONE: Core language structure**

**Phonology Decisions:**
- Minimal inventory: only sounds distinguishable cross-linguistically
- Labial/Alveolar/Velar consonant series
- 5-vowel system (i/e/a/o/u)
- Optional nasal coda only
- Bare vowels reserved exclusively for grammar

**Root Selection (48 total):**
- Existence & Substance (3): ta, to, su
- Pronouns & Deictics (5): mi, tu, si, ni, ka
- Primary Qualities (8): wo/now, pi/nip, lo/nun, ko/wa...
- Actions (12): mo, ke, ku, se, li, te, wi, me, wan, pu, lu, lin
- Spatial (6): na, pe, so, ti, we, la
- Temporal (4): ne, pa, lon, nu
- Quantity (4): wen, le, mu, pan
- Logical (4): no, kan, kon, sin
- Relational (2): san, pen

## v0.0.1 — Initial Concept (2025-12-01)
**MILESTONE: "What if we built a language in 5 hours?"**

The seed question that started it all. Constraints established:
- Minimal phoneme inventory
- Experiential semantics only
- Unambiguous grammar
- Writable by hand efficiently

## Development Notes

**Total Development Time:** ~5 hours  
**Collaboration:** Human (wofl) + AI (Claude Opus 4.5)  
**Methodology:** Iterative constraint satisfaction  
**Philosophy:** Inevitable rather than invented  

**What Emerged Beyond Language:**

This changelog documents the technical development of Mesu. But the repository also contains `insight-gained.md` — a document that captures something more personal that emerged during the creation process. The language became a vehicle for understanding something I'd carried for 40 years.

That's not a version number. That's just... what happened.
