# Code of Conduct

## ◎˙●˙╎ ┈ ◎˙┆˙ — We Are Mesu

This project exists because of collaboration — between humans, and between human and AI. The language itself emerged from that spirit. We expect the community around it to embody the same.

## Our Standards

**Be respectful.** Mesu has 48 roots. One of them is *ma* — "good." Lead with that.

**Be constructive.** Critique ideas, not people. If you think something could be better, show how.

**Be inclusive.** Language belongs to everyone who speaks it. Mesu was designed to be learnable by any human regardless of their native tongue. Our community should be equally accessible.

**Be patient.** Not everyone learns at the same pace. Not everyone has the same background. That's fine. Help each other.

## Specifically

We welcome:
- Questions about the language (no question is too basic)
- Proposals for new vocabulary or refinements
- Translations, creative works, and experiments
- Discussion of the AI collaboration that created this
- Personal stories about what language means to you

We don't welcome:
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Gatekeeping ("real" conlangers, "proper" linguistics, etc.)
- Bad-faith arguments or trolling
- Spam or off-topic promotion

## The Personal Dimension

This repository contains more than just a language specification. It contains a personal document (`insight-gained.md`) about mental health, childhood experiences, and self-discovery. 

Please treat that content with care. It's there because transparency matters and because the language and the insight are inseparable. But it's also someone's actual life.

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:
1. A gentle reminder
2. Removal of the offending content
3. Temporary or permanent exclusion from community spaces

The goal isn't punishment — it's maintaining a space where people feel safe to learn, create, and share.

## Contact

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Email: contact@whispr.dev
- GitHub: Open an issue (for non-sensitive matters)

## Attribution

Adapted from the Contributor Covenant v2.1, modified for the specific context of a constructed language community.
