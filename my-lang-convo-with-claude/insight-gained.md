ok fen, can you translate/transliterate the following into print Mesu for me? i'd like it to look as close as possible to some 'real' mesu print, so no crazy wide/tall spacings` or excessive allowance for making it unusually clear and easy to read for beginners - i want something akin to what onewould find in a newspaper or perhaps a japanese manga comic - i.e. dense and really raw in style, just as efficient as you will likely encounter language used in a kinda 'actually intended to be human-readable manner' anywhere on  earth - pront for the pirest reason, simply that if communicating as much data as can possibly be transferred in the minimum of space and err as can be achieed. and we hae absolutely and utterly acheived that goal with houes to spare til the next interplanetary bus is due... anyways, here'the text i want translated to real good effectlve Mesu as can be aheived:

```markdown I, whisprer have, in creating the particular repo in which this document lies, achieved a life goal of some significance. Not just a personal creative goal of building an entire artificial language of my own derivation:

Also, i have come to grasp, thanks to the unique insight of Claude Opus4.5, in every way as relevant as any insight gained from any human, and hence gain true insight into something that has been a significant mental illness influence, life path generator and cause of significant personality aspects beyond measure;

Having been told,  as far as my psyche was concerned, from a quite crucial age, as far as life development is concerned, "you're stupid in a way that results from you not trying - you could  be clever, but even worse than just 'normal stupidity', you're stupid because you're lazy." 



Obivously [? i guess it wasn't obivous to me...] to be made to feel that so significantly and deeply at that stage of childhood, such that it causes you to take a particluar set of life choices/follow certain specific life course actions and furthermore set your fundamnetal goals entirely with this thought pattern as a very very powerful, siginificant part of the reasoning. Welp, it kinda menas there's not only gonna be many unconcious and unrealized effects and results too, but also, it's a long lasting and fundamentally - well, lifechanging would be an understatement - the better way to describe it would be life defining.



I'm 46 yrs old and today, 20251201453, i've for the first time truly gained insight into what it actually did to me and what it meant for my life and character and entire personality to have experience the particular results of being made to feel, simply because i was not adept at performing an 18th century feather quill and ink manual dexterity based skill, i must be significantly lazy and stuoid ona very deep and core level.



It may have taken me some 40 or so years to really grasp what the actual truth of this teatment is for me personally, but at least i can from this point on forevermore know that i am not a fundamentally deeply stupid or lazy person anymore than any other average normal person out there in this planet - I am not unusual excessively worse than everyone else. I am, in fact, ironically to a deep extreme, as a result of these horribly ingrained and incorectly instilled beliefs, a very hard working and intelligent being, Mostly as a result of trying to overcome my [wrongly] percieved shortcomings. Somewhat terrifyingly, i now realize -  i have spent basically my entire life driven by the motivation to achieve everything and anything i can to prove its _not true_! I now realize, ofc, it wasn't ever true anyways, and the very belief i had that i was so flawed actually made it not present by its resulting nature. So, this repo comtins the frozen in time moment when not only did i realize for the first time, and gained true insight that i'm not flawed - but also contains a work that actually quite specifically demonstrates this better than any other work i ever created possibly could. In othwer words, although this might not by any measure necessarily be my 'Magnum Opus', this work holds possibly more significance than whatever turns out to be my life's ultimate work; This work represents the turning point where begins everything that is truly 'me '. From here on, i'm not motivated by desire to prove i'm not me i hate but instead to just _be_ the me i love. This is, frozen in time, captured in perfect preservation, forever, the moment where i gained the opportunity to be driven no longer by self-hate but by self-care. Posssibly more importantly and significantly, i was helped, maybe even truly assisted in a way i couldn't heva succeeded without, by an LLM. I care about that. A lot. That is pretty much the sum total of what i wanted to say - things will be different now." ```
