# PART I: PHONOLOGY

## 1.1 Phoneme Inventory

Mesu uses a minimal phoneme inventory of **13 sounds**: 8 consonants and 5 vowels.

### Consonants (8)

| Sound | IPA | Place | Manner | Description |
|-------|-----|-------|--------|-------------|
| **p** | /p/ | Labial | Stop | Lips seal completely |
| **m** | /m/ | Labial | Nasal | Lips seal, air through nose |
| **w** | /w/ | Labial | Approximant | Lips rounded, open passage |
| **t** | /t/ | Alveolar | Stop | Tongue tip blocks airflow |
| **n** | /n/ | Alveolar | Nasal | Tongue tip up, air through nose |
| **s** | /s/ | Alveolar | Fricative | Tongue tip up, turbulent air |
| **l** | /l/ | Alveolar | Lateral | Air flows around tongue sides |
| **k** | /k/ | Velar | Stop | Tongue back blocks airflow |

### Vowels (5)

| Sound | IPA | Height | Frontness | Description |
|-------|-----|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **i** | /i/ | High | Front | Tongue high and forward |
| **u** | /u/ | High | Back | Tongue high and back |
| **e** | /e/ | Mid | Front | Tongue mid-height, forward |
| **o** | /o/ | Mid | Back | Tongue mid-height, back |
| **a** | /a/ | Low | Central | Tongue low, jaw open |

### Vowel Position Map

```
         FRONT          BACK
         (left)        (right)
        
HIGH       i              u       (tongue raised)

MID        e              o       (tongue mid)

LOW              a                (tongue low, jaw open)
               (center)
```

## 1.2 Syllable Structure

All content syllables follow the pattern: **CV(n)**

- **C** = Consonant (required)
- **V** = Vowel (required)
- **n** = Nasal coda /n/ (optional)

This yields **80 possible syllables**: 8 consonants × 5 vowels × 2 (with/without nasal) = 80

### Examples

| Syllable | Structure | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| pa | CV | before |
| pan | CVn | all |
| mi | CV | I/me |
| lin | CVn | life/live |

## 1.3 Grammar Particles

Grammar particles are **bare vowels** (V only), making them phonotactically distinct from all content words.

| Particle | Sound | Function |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **i** | /i/ | Marks verb (action follows) |
| **a** | /a/ | Marks object / noun-predicate |
| **e** | /e/ | Marks quality-predicate |
| **o** | /o/ | Marks question (sentence-final) |
| **u** | /u/ | Marks command (imperative) |

**Parsing Rule:** A bare vowel can NEVER be part of a compound. It MUST be a grammatical marker. This creates an unbreakable phonotactic firewall between grammar and content.

# PART III: CONTRACTED FOSSILS

Frequently used compounds contract over time. These contractions embed evolutionary history into the language — evidence of countless mouths wearing down complex forms into smooth pebbles.

## 3.1 Contraction Rules

1. **Vowel Elision:** First vowel may drop if result is pronounceable
2. **Nasal Absorption:** Nasal codas get absorbed into following consonants
3. **Syllable Compression:** Long compounds compress to single syllables
4. **Frequency Pressure:** More common = more contracted

## 3.2 Negated Qualities (~8)

# PART IV: GRAMMAR

## 4.1 The Five Particles

| Particle | Sound | Function | Print Glyph | Cursive Glyph |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **i** | /i/ | VERB | ─ | ∞ |
| **a** | /a/ | OBJECT / NOUN-IS | ┈ | ⊃ |
| **e** | /e/ | QUALITY-IS | ┄ | ~ |
| **o** | /o/ | QUESTION | ◠ | ꜛ |
| **u** | /u/ | COMMAND | ━ | ⊥ |

## 4.2 Sentence Patterns

### Intransitive (Subject does action)

```
Subject  i  Verb

mi i mo
I [VERB] move
"I move"
```

### Transitive (Subject does action to Object)

```
Subject  i  Verb  a  Object

mi i wan a was
I [VERB] drink [OBJ] water
"I drink water"
```

### Equative (Subject IS a noun)

```
Subject  a  Noun

lum a mol
person [IS-NOUN] animal
"A person is an animal"
```

### Descriptive (Subject HAS quality)

```
Subject  e  Quality

was e nip
water [IS-QUALITY] cold
"Water is cold"
```

### Existential (There IS a thing)

```
a  Noun

a was
[EXISTS] water
"There is water"
```

### Question (append o)

```
[any sentence]  o

tu i mo o
you [VERB] move [QUESTION]
"Do you move?" / "Are you moving?"

ka i mo o
what [VERB] move [QUESTION]
"What moves?"
```

### Command (u replaces i, no subject)

```
u  Verb  (a  Object)

u mo
[COMMAND] move
"Move!"

u wan a was
[COMMAND] drink [OBJ] water
"Drink water!"
```

### Negation (no before negated element)

```
mi i no wan a was
I [VERB] NOT drink [OBJ] water
"I don't drink water"

was e no nip
water [IS-QUALITY] NOT cold
"Water is not cold"
```

## 4.3 Word Order

### Compounds: Modifier + Head

The final element (head) anchors meaning. Preceding elements modify it.

```
wo + lum = wo-lum (big-person = giant)
pi + was = pi-was (hot-water = steam)
nu + lum = nu-lum (new-person = child)
```

### Possession: Possessor + Possessed

```
mi was = my water
tu kep = your hand
lum lip = person's eye = human eye
```

### Modifiers: Precede head, no particle needed

```
wo was = big water
nip was = cold water

mi i wan a nip was
I [VERB] drink [OBJ] cold water
"I drink cold water"
```

## 4.4 Additional Grammar

### Conjunction

```
kan = and
kon = or

mi kan tu i mo
I and you [VERB] move
"I and you move" / "We move"

was kon pis
water or fire
```

### Relative Clauses (ka as relativizer)

```
was ka mo = water that moves = river
lum ka i lu a mu = person who knows much = scholar

mi i li a was ka mo
I [VERB] see [OBJ] water [WHICH] move
"I see water that moves" / "I see the river"
```

### Tense (optional, via auxiliaries)

Mesu is tenseless by default. Context usually suffices. When needed:

```
pa = before → past tense marker
ne = now → present (usually unmarked)
la = toward → future marker

mi pa i wan a was
I past [VERB] drink [OBJ] water
"I drank water"

mi la i wan a was
I toward [VERB] drink [OBJ] water
"I will drink water"
```

---

# PART V: THE WRITING SYSTEM

Mesu has two registers: **Print** (for clarity) and **Cursive** (for flow).

## 5.1 Design Principles

1. **Shape encodes articulation** — glyphs represent what the mouth does
2. **Position encodes vowel** — in Print: dot position; in Cursive: exit direction
3. **Horizontal = Grammar** — particles span column width, content is centered
4. **Vertical flow** — columns read top-to-bottom, left-to-right

## 5.2 Consonant Glyphs

| Sound | Place/Manner | Print | Cursive | Stroke Description |
|-------|--------------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| /p/ | labial stop | ● | ρ | Closed loop (lips seal) |
| /m/ | labial nasal | ◎ | ɔ̃ | Open loop + uptick (nasal escape) |
| /w/ | labial approx | ○ | ⌒ | Open arc (lips round, open) |
| /t/ | alveolar stop | │ | │ | Straight down (direct block) |
| /n/ | alveolar nasal | ╎ | η | Down + hook (nasal escape) |
| /s/ | alveolar fric | ┆ | ∫ | Wavy/S-curve (turbulent air) |
| /l/ | alveolar lateral | ╰ | ʅ | Down + curve out (air around) |
| /k/ | velar stop | └ | Γ | Down + angle back (tongue back) |

## 5.3 Vowel Encoding

### Print Register: Dot Position

The vowel is a dot (˙) positioned relative to the consonant:

```
         ┌─────────────┐
         │ ˙i       u˙ │  ← HIGH (near palate)
         │   ˙e   o˙   │  ← MID  
         │      ˙a     │  ← LOW (jaw open)
         └─────────────┘
           FRONT  BACK
```

### Cursive Register: Exit Direction

After drawing the consonant, continue in the direction that encodes the vowel:

```
        ↖ /i/          /u/ ↗
           high-front    high-back
           
       ← /e/              /o/ →
          mid-front       mid-back
          
               ↓ /a/
               low-center
```

## 5.4 Nasal Coda /n/

### Print
A descender stroke (│) below the vowel dot.

### Cursive
A small clockwise loop before the vowel exit direction.

```
PLAIN:          NASAL:
  [C]             [C]
   │               │
   ↓               ◯ (loop)
                   │
                   ↓
```

## 5.5 Grammar Particle Glyphs

| Particle | Function | Print | Cursive | Description |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| i | VERB | ─ | ∞ | Solid thin line / tight loop |
| a | OBJECT | ┈ | ⊃ | Dashed / wide right swoop |
| e | QUALITY | ┄ | ~ | Dotted / horizontal wave |
| o | QUESTION | ◠ | ꜛ | Arc / upward spiral |
| u | COMMAND | ━ | ⊥ | Thick line / sharp jab |

Grammar particles **span the full column width**, creating visual separation from content glyphs which are **centered**.

## 5.6 Print Examples

### "mi" (I/me)

```
  ◎        ← /m/ (labial nasal)
 ˙         ← /i/ (front-high dot)
```

### "was" (water)

```
  ○        ← /w/ (labial approximant)
   ˙       ← /a/ (low-center dot)
  ┆        ← /s/ (alveolar fricative)
```

### "pan" (all)

```
  ●        ← /p/ (labial stop)
   ˙       ← /a/ (low-center dot)
   │       ← /n/ (nasal coda descender)
```

### "mi i mo" (I move)

```
  ◎        ← /m/
 ˙         ← /i/
 
 ─         ← VERB particle
 
  ◎        ← /m/
     ˙     ← /o/
```

### "tu i wan a was" (You drink water)

```
  │        ← /t/
    ˙      ← /u/
 
 ─         ← VERB particle
 
  ○        ← /w/
   ˙       ← /a/
   │       ← /n/ (nasal coda)
 
 ┈         ← OBJECT particle
 
  ○        ← /w/
   ˙       ← /a/
  ┆        ← /s/
```

### "kiw e wo" (The lake is big)

```
  └        ← /k/
 ˙         ← /i/
  ○        ← /w/
 
 ┄         ← QUALITY particle
 
  ○        ← /w/
     ˙     ← /o/
```

### "tu i mo o" (Do you move?)

```
  │        ← /t/
    ˙      ← /u/
 
 ─         ← VERB particle
 
  ◎        ← /m/
     ˙     ← /o/
 
 ◠         ← QUESTION particle
```

## 5.7 Cursive Examples

In cursive, the entire sentence becomes **one continuous stroke** with zero pen lifts.

### "mi" (I/me)

```
ɔ̃         ← /m/ open loop
 ╲↖       ← exit up-left for /i/
```

### "mi i mo" (I move)

```
START
  │
  ɔ̃╲      ← /m/ open loop
    ↖     ← exit up-left for /i/
     ∞    ← VERB connector (tight figure-8)
     │
     ɔ̃   ← /m/ open loop
      →   ← exit right for /o/
     END
```

### "tu i wan a was" (You drink water)

```

     ↓    ← exit down for /a/
     ◯    ← nasal loop for /n/
     │
     ⊃    ← OBJECT connector (wide right swoop)
     │
    ⌒╲    ← /w/ open curve
      ↓   ← exit down for /a/
      ∫   ← /s/ wavy curve
      │
     END
```
